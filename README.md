# Monotty Fonts

UPDATE: [May 2024]
- Practice has shown that for correct display of the Devanagari script in the terminal, there is no need for special fonts - those proportional ones that exist are quite sufficient (e.g. [Noto Sans Devanagari](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Devanagari)). The only thing that is needed is the support for tailored grapheme clustering on the terminal side. Here's a description of the approach: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/issues/23. The fonts in our repository are not correct, do not use them.
- Maybe in the future we'll make our fonts proportional.

### ~~Monospaced Fonts for Terminals~~

__Monotty__ is shortening for for two words: `Monospaced` and `TTY` (Teletype, Terminal).

These fonts are mainly intended for experiments with displaying CTL scripts in terminal emulators supporting the character slicing. (See [Unicode Variation Selectors as Size Modifiers](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/issues/23)). This font has not been finalized to the level of practical use, and so far it contains some inaccuracies that are not critical for the experiments.
