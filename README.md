# The Monotty font project
## Monospaced fonts for terminals with CTL support

__Monotty__ is shortening for for two words: `Monospaced` and `TTY` (Teletype, Terminal).

Example of output

These fonts are mainly intended for experiments with displaying CTL scripts in terminal emulators supporting the character slicing. (See [the new SGR attribute](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/issues/23)). This font has not been finalized to the level of practical use, and so far it contains some inaccuracies that are not critical for the experiments.

### Writing Systems
- [ ] [Brahmic scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmic_scripts)
  - [x] Devanagari `<dev2>`

    - [x] Marathi `<MAR >`
  - [ ] Bengali `<bng2>`
  - [ ] Gujarati `<gjr2>`

## Specification

- Weight: configurable stroke width
- Em size: 2000
- Ð¡haracter width: monospaced, exactly 1/2em
- Ascent: 1300

## Building the font (e.g. generate the `.ttf` file) from source

The font binaries are not directly part of this repository, as it only contains source files; however, the binaries are directly built from the `.sfd` files. This requires the [FontForge Monotty Edition](https://github.com/monotty/fontforge).

You can also download the last generated file
 - Devanagari `<dev2>`: [`monotty-dev2.ttf`](https://dice.netxs.online/cloud/monotty/monotty-dev2.ttf)

### Building stages 
- Use the source `.sfd`

- Build all glyphs, or only selected glyphs, specifying the desired brush shape
