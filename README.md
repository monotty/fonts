# The Monotty font project
### Monospaced fonts for terminals with CTL support

__Monotty__ is shortening for for two words: `Monospaced` and `TTY` (Teletype, Terminal).

Example of output

These fonts are mainly intended for experiments with displaying CTL scripts in terminal emulators supporting the character slicing. (See [the new SGR attribute](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/issues/23)). This font has not been finalized to the level of practical use, and so far it contains some inaccuracies that are not critical for the experiments.
