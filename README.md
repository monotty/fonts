# Monotty Fonts

### Monospaced Fonts for Terminals

![image](.resources/github-devanagari.png)

__Monotty__ is shortening for for two words: `Monospaced` and `TTY` (Teletype, Terminal).

These fonts are mainly intended for experiments with displaying CTL scripts in terminal emulators supporting the character slicing. (See [Unicode Variation Selectors as Size Modifiers](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/issues/23)). This font has not been finalized to the level of practical use, and so far it contains some inaccuracies that are not critical for the experiments.
